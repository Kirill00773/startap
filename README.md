# Startup
Software for recognizing the name of a car part (whole or broken) from photographs and displaying the place of sale and information about it
# Problems:
- Ignorance of car parts
- Labor intensity in finding quality parts at a good price
# How it works:
  Using this software, a novice motorist takes photographs of everything necessary to replace a part. The program recognizes its name based on the photograph and displays a list of stores and websites where it is sold, indicating the prices of the manufacturing countries, as well as a list of service centers that provide replacement services for this part. The software also provides information about the purpose of this spare part and brief instructions on how to install it yourself.
 # Software advantages:
- Time to select and search for a choice of parts
- Study of various parts and devices
